# movie_reviews_v01
A dynamic version of the static spoof of Rotten Tomatoes.

This site allows visits to different movie reviews using PHP, HTML and CSS. The largest challenge of course was styling.

I was given an image of what the site should look like, the review text and the movie description text and images, and asked to match it exactly. This PHP webpage is the result of that exercise.

The basic idea is that you have several different movies which are stored in text files. Upon request, the app matches the request params with the requested movie and loads the data into the UI dynamically.
