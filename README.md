# movie_reviews_v01
A dynamic version of the static spoof of Rotten Tomatoes.

This site allows visits to different movie reviews using PHP, HTML and CSS. The largest challenge of course was styling.

The basic idea is that you have several different movies which are stored in text files. Upon request, the app matches the request params with the requested movie and loads the data into the UI dynamically. For this implementation there is no JavaScript whatsoever. It was a continuation of a previous (non-dynamic) implementation which stressed the use of proper CSS, particularly as it relates to columns using the "float" and "clear" properties.
